    about_jiraps_authentication

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    In order to authenticate with the Jira server, the user can provide the
    credentials with each command or create a session.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    At present, there are two main methods of authenticating to Jira:
    * HTTP basic authentication
    * session-based authentication, which uses HTTP basic authentication once
    and preserves a session cookie.
    > Be sure to set JIRA up to use HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate if you
    are concerned about security!

HTTP Basic
    Each JiraPS function that queries a Jira instance provides a `-Credential`
    parameter. Simply pass your Jira credentials to this parameter.

    $cred = Get-Credential 'powershell'
    Get-JiraIssue TEST-01 -Credential $cred

    > HTTP basic authentication is not a secure form of authentication. It uses
    a Base64-encoded String of the format "username:password", and passes this
    string in clear text to Jira. Because decrypting this string and obtaining
    the username and password is trivial, the use of HTTPS is critical in any
    system that needs to remain secure.

Sessions
    Jira sessions still require HTTP Basic Authentication once to create the
    connection. But in this case a persistent session is saved as a
    `WebRequestSession`. This is Powershell's way of reusing the data provided
    with the first call.
    > Previously Jira allowed for the authentication to use a session token.
    This token did not contain the username and password. > But unfortunately,
    this API can no longer be used in combination with this module.
    To create a Jira session, you can use the New-JiraSession function:

    $cred = Get-Credential 'powershell'
    New-JiraSession -Credential $cred

    Once you've created this session, you're done! You don't need to specify it
    when running other commands - JiraPS will manage this session internally.
    The session is stored in the module's runtime. This means that it will not
    be available in a new Powershell session or if the module is reloaded.

What About OAuth?
    Jira does support use of OAuth, but JiraPS does not yet. This is a to-do
    item.
